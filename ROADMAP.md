# Roadmap

The roadmap here is a living document of where the client-facing app is intending to go and things needed to be done in the near future. Since we can't really predict the best way of doing things, this may be flexible and subject to change.

## Timeline
The aim is to get the majority of these goals done by the end of the semester of even year.

## Short term goals
These goals should hopefully be tackled in one to two months.
* 

## Long term goals
These goals are more difficult to give a timeline for. They are ordered by increasing difficulty.
*

## Backlog
The backlog covers features that aren't long-term goals but would be useful to have.
